        <div>Points are represented by coordinates P(X, Y)</div>
        <div>Lines are represented by two points, marking their beginning and ending L(P1(X1,Y1), P2(X2,Y2))</div>
        <h3>Calculate the distance between two points.</h3>
        <h3>Check if three segment lines can form a triangle.</h3>
        <p>The result can be observed in the browser console</p>
